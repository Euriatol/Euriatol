Hi, this is me, @Euriatol ! I'm currently a 17 yo student and I enjoy programming and maths to.

Learning programation by doing projects is, I think, the best way possible. This is why I'm working on a new project : WLBB which stands for Well Light Berry Bush. The name is pretty bad but I couldn't find a better one to describe a project whose goal is controlling leds "randomly" placed from as litle as a Raspberry Pi.
